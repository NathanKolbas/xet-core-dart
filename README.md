This library uses the awesome [flutter_rust_bridge](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rust_bridge) to make the dart <-> rust bindings easier.

Unfortunately, this library requires flutter. While flutter_rust_bridge does support pure dart, [the official toolchain](https://github.com/dart-lang/native/issues/883) for this has yet to be released. When this is done this library will be pure dart. You can find more information noted in [flutter_rust_bridge's documentation](https://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/guides/miscellaneous/pure-dart).

## Welcome

`hf-xet` enables `huggingface_hub` to utilize xet storage for uploading and downloading to HF Hub. Xet storage provides chunk-based deduplication, efficient storage/retrieval with local disk caching, and backwards compatibility with Git LFS. This library is not meant to be used directly, and is instead intended to be used from [huggingface_hub](https://pub.dev/packages/huggingface_hub).

## Key features

‚ôª **chunk-based deduplication implementation**: avoid transferring and storing chunks that are shared across binary files (models, datasets, etc).

ü§ó **Dart bindings**: bindings for [huggingface_hub](https://pub.dev/packages/huggingface_hub/) package.

‚Üî **network communications**: concurrent communication to HF Hub Xet backend services (CAS).

üîñ **local disk caching**: chunk-based cache that sits alongside the existing [huggingface_hub disk cache](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache).

## Installation

Install the `hf_xet` package with [pub](https://pub.dev/packages/hf-xet/):

```bash
flutter pub install hf_xet
```

## Setup

To make sure everything is set up call `HfXet.ensureInitialized` from the initialization of your application. Here is an example for a flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:hf_xet/hf_xet.dart';

void main() async {  
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await HfXet.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Rest of your main function...
}
```

### MacOS

You may need the internet permission so that models can be downloaded. To do this add the following to both your `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```

If you are looking for a concrete example checkout the `example/` directory.

TODO: This might be possible to put directly in the package so others don't have to do this

### iOS

You may need the internet permission so that models can be downloaded. To do this add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
   <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/>
</dict>
```

I did not have to do this but just in case you run into this issue you'll know how to fix it.

## Quick Start

`hf_xet` is not intended to be run independently as it is expected to be used from `huggingface_hub`, so to get started with `huggingface_hub` check out the documentation [here]("https://hf.co/docs/huggingface_hub").

## Known Issues/Limits

Xet only works on 64-bit systems; 32-bit systems are [not supported](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/storage-backends#current-limitations).
